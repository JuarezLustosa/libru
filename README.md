# Libru
Software to help manage libraries for free. 


The idea of this project is to offer free software to libraries where haven't financial conditional to buy or maintain one. 

We are in the 2020s and Yes you can believe it I found a municipal library where they don't have software to manage who borrow the title, and they haven't the titles cataloged. They are using a spreadsheet to do that, and have 40.000 titles to manage. So I have this idea to help them and other libraries, creating software by the community opensource to help us.
